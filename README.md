Do similar films use a similar language? SUB ROSA addresses this question by giving users the ability to examine movies for  speech-related features. These features are extracted from subtitle data using methods from Natural Language Processing, Stylometry and Information Retrieval.  
For detailed information about these methods, please read this [paper](https://github.com/bbrause/subrosa/raw/master/Luhmann_2019_MovieSimilarities.pdf).

This work was realized by Jan Luhmann as part of the course ”Drama Mining und Film-Analyse” (summer semester 2019) under the supervision of Manuel Burghardt and Jochen Tiepmar at the University of Leipzig.  

Subtitle data was kindly provided by the team of OpenSubtitles.
